## Motovation

After learning about progressive web applications I wanted to build something simple that could help me build a further understanding of all the concepts

## Installation / Usage

When you visit the app at https://jate-the-pwa-text-editor.herokuapp.com/ - simply click the install button and the app will be available to you on your device. Otherwise, dont click install and use it on the web


## Successes

It was an astounding success to have the application launch onto Heroku without any issues!
